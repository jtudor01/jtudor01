<h1>Customer Service</h1>
<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;">Delta makes billions of dollars a year but don't even have the decency to treat their customer's right. A review on TripAdvisor said, "My husband and I travel light with only carryons, largely because of the $30 per bag fee to check. I avoid no frills airlines, but Delta seems to have adopted all of their nickel and dime tactics. When we checked in for our flights online, unless we paid $30 per person, they threaten they can put you anywhere - and they do. Middle seats in the back of the plane. The service was fine and seats were as comfortable as they could be, crammed all in. Aisle is too narrow to roll my small bag. TV screen and free movies was nice. Coming home, we were at the airport early and checked into taking an earlier flight at our gate. We hadn't checked bags and seats were available - but we would have to pay $75 each for the privilege. So frustrated. Why should us filling an earlier seat incur a fee? I am so tired of airlines abusing their power to rip off passengers. Disgusting." </p>
