<p> The Apple website is very organized and everything on it is easily visible. What sets the Apple Website apart from others is that it is very minimalist while also having everything anyone could need on it. This makes it look like a futuristic website. The code looks a little chaotic to me and most of it is not inside of a table, but it is in html. The website has also been validated. One column is used for the first half of the website. Once you scroll down half way it turns into two columns. It only takes a couple of seconds to scroll through the whole website. Navigation throughout the website is easy. At the top there are options of different Apple devices to click on. At the bottom you can find an Apple store location or look at the services Apple has to offer. All sorts of different colors are used throughout the website, but it is mostly colors like white, gray, and black. This is most likely done intentionally because we associate white, gray, and black with Apple and Technology in general. The other colors on the website, pink, red, blue, green, are meant to show the vibrancy of their products and contrast the basic main colors of the site.
	I like the Nike website because it is colorful and pleasing to look at. It sets itself apart by offering lots of high quality pictures of their products. The code is extremely organized and clean. It is written in html, uses tables and is validated. The layout of the website is not the best. It switches back and forth between two and three columns. It makes the website look a little messy, rather than seamless. It is easy to get around the website. At the top of the website it has a drop down menu for men, women, and children. At the bottom it has more buttons to click on for specific items. The main color for the website is white. Using white as the main color was the right choice because it’s what everyone thinks of when they think of Nike. People think of sneakers and more specifically white sneakers. Every color in the rainbow is included in the pictures though.
	The Craigslist website is not a good website because it looks awful. The colors, design, and layout are all terrible and make it look like a much older website. The code is not too bad. It’s written in html, it’s organized, and it has some tables. The layout of the website is not good. It has three columns. On the left is random stuff, in the middle are the services available, and on the right are locations to search from. While it does have some general sections, everything seems kind of random and it is hard to find things you need. The major colors are gray, white, and blue. It does not work out well. Just looking at it kind of burns your eyes. Since it sells a variety of items and services it would be hard to pick one color to fit everyone. However they could do better than the colors they picked. The font they used for most of the text does not work well and neither does the blue color.
