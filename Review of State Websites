1. Nebraska is my favorite state website. This is because everything is easy to find, it looks clean, it's organized, and it's not filled with irrelevant information. The Nebraska website has a drop down bar at the top, search bar in the middle, statistics, with twitter and a calendar at the bottom.
3. The Alaska website also has a drop down bar at the top, a section for residents, businesses, and visitors, government information on the right side links to social media at the bottom. The colors look good and I like the pictures as well. The biggest problem with this website is that it is kind of crowded with options to click on.
4. The Illinois website has a drop down bar at the top, a virtual assistant in the middle, covid information, services and agencies listed near the bottom. Overall it looks like a pretty good website. Everything is easy to find and the information is not overwhelming. I also liked the images and design of the website.
5.The Delaware website has a drop down menu at the top, news highlights, and information of politicians at the bottom. It is a good looking website. If I could change one thing I would change the colors because they are kind of boring. 
6. Florida is my least favorite state website. It only has a search bar and not much more. I would prefer more options than just a search bar. The lack of other buttons to press does make it look more aesthetically pleasing though.
