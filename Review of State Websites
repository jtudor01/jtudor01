1. Nebraska is my favorite state website. This is because everything is easy to find, it looks clean and organized, it's not filled with irrelevant information, it looks sleek
2. It has a drop down bar at the top, search bar in the middle, statistics, with twitter and a calendar at the bottom
3. It also has a drop down bar at the top, a section for residents, businesses, and visitors, government information on the right side links to social media at the bottom
4.
