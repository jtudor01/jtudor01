1. Nebraska is my favorite state website. This is because everything is easy to find, it looks clean and organized, it's not filled with irrelevant information, it looks sleek.
2. The Nebraska website has a drop down bar at the top, search bar in the middle, statistics, with twitter and a calendar at the bottom.
3. The Alaska website also has a drop down bar at the top, a section for residents, businesses, and visitors, government information on the right side links to social media at the bottom.
4. The Illinois website has a drop down bar at the top, a virtual assistant in the middle, covid information, services and agencies listed near the bottom.
5. Florida is my least favorite state website. It only has a search bar and not much more. I would prefer more options than just a search bar.
